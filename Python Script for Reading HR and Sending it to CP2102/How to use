This folder contains the Python Script 

To use the script 
Step - 1) Put the Mac Address of the Chest Strap Sensor into the Mac address line
Step - 2) Use a BLE Scanner to find the service that reads the heart rate through sensor and put it in the uuid of the measurement
Step - 3) Run the Script to read the hr

A Demo Script is also Included just to read the hr to check if it is working or not
After using the Demo Script to send the HR , use the USB Script and put the usb port through which the CP2102 is connected

(Same Step 1,2 for the actual script)

Step - 4) Put the usb port address in the script

/dev/ttyUSBX , X = Port number
check with: 'ls /dev/ttyUSB*' in terminal or konsole
- if using Windows then it would be in the form of 
COMX , X = port number
Check with: 'COMX' USB Ports in Device Manager
